Hey Hope you are doing well, 
I am Utsav. Currently I am a student at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany.     
I like to talk about deep learning, computer vision, robotics and mathematics.    

Currently working at [Gerhard Schubert GmbH](https://www.schubert.group/) as Software Developer Intern in Deep Learning/Computer Vision with the Cobot Division. Schubert is the Porsche of packaging industry across Europe (as my Project leader says, imagine 80 pick and place operations in a minute !). Here I mostly work on optimizing [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) algorithms for faster inference by the cobots.  

With that. I'm also doing research for the company to use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automate (partly automate) Programming System for the cobot.   


> **UPDATE May 2024**: Currently learning more about startups, large language models and computer vision.    



## Projects   
1) **LLMs into Robot**: I tried to integrate GPT-3.5 model to understand natural language human commands and control the robot.See how it works [here](https://github.com/theutsavpanchal/LLM_ROS).  

2) **Android App to Detect Human Position:** Built an android app, part of University work. The app detects 12 human positions. Find the android app [here](https://github.com/theutsavpanchal/deep-learning-lab/tree/main/har_app/har2) and more details about the project [here](https://github.com/theutsavpanchal/deep-learning-lab/tree/main/human_activity_recognition).    

3) **Rust Library for STM32F0XX:** Built this library using [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, when I was working for a startup. I built this library 6 months before it was released officially by guys working at STM (reason why the project is special for me !). Find my version [here](https://github.com/theutsavpanchal/STM32F04XX_Flash) and the official version [here](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f0xx-hal/blob/master/src/flash.rs)




## Reading List  

As of now I am learning more about Generative AI, I really liked the story behind [Github Copilot's success](https://github.blog/2023-09-06-how-to-build-an-enterprise-llm-application-lessons-from-github-copilot/) and how the [companies are boosting](https://github.blog/2023-05-09-how-companies-are-boosting-productivity-with-generative-ai/) its productivity using Generative AI.   

[Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.github.io/) blogposts are my go to for deep learning and large language models. 
I like to read novels, books on productivity (not motivational) and startups.  

Follow my reading list here. 

Sometimes I like to read [Paul Graham's Essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html).      
**Currently Reading:**   
1) The Four Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferris.   

**Completed**
