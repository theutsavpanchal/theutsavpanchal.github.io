Hey Hope you are doing well, 
I am Utsav. Currently I am a student at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany.     
I like to talk about deep learning, computer vision, robotics and mathematics.    

Currently working at [Gerhard Schubert GmbH](https://www.schubert.group/) as Software Developer Intern in Deep Learning/Computer Vision with the Cobot Division. Schubert is the Porsche of packaging machines across Europe (as my Project leader says, imagine 80 pick and place operations in a minute !). Here I mostly work on optimizing [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) algorithms for faster inference by the cobots.  

With that. I'm also doing research for the company to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate (partly automate) Programming System for the cobot.   



> **UPDATE May 2024**: Currently learning more about startups, large language models and computer vision.    

As of now I am learning more about Generative AI, I really liked the story behind [Github Copilot's success](https://github.blog/2023-09-06-how-to-build-an-enterprise-llm-application-lessons-from-github-copilot/) and how the [companies are boosting](https://github.blog/2023-05-09-how-companies-are-boosting-productivity-with-generative-ai/) its productivity using Generative AI.   

[Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.github.io/) blogposts are my go to for deep learning and large language models. 

## Reading List
I like to read novels, books on productivity (not motivational) and startups.
