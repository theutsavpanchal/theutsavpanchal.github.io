Hey Hope you are doing well, 
I am Utsav. Currently I am a student at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany.     
I like to talk about deep learning, computer vision, robotics and mathematics.    

I build this website just to keep track of what I am currently doing so that I won't forget in few days, but hey, you are welcome to read. I won't post any programming blogs or project explanation in here, for that refer to my [Github account](https://github.com/theutsavpanchal){:target="_blank"} if you are interested. 

In my previous companies,  I used to develop softwares for Embedded systems. But now I mostly work with deep learning and computer vision.   
**UPDATE May 2024**: Currently learning more about startups, large language models and computer vision.   
As of now I am learning more about Generative AI, I really liked the story behind [Github Copilot's success](https://github.blog/2023-09-06-how-to-build-an-enterprise-llm-application-lessons-from-github-copilot/) and how the [companies are boosting](https://github.blog/2023-05-09-how-companies-are-boosting-productivity-with-generative-ai/) its productivity using Generative AI.
