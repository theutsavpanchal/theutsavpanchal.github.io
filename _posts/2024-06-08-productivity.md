Here's what I learn from [Sam Altman's Productivity Blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity).

1) Prioritize getting the important work done and avoid wasting time on unimportant tasks.  

2) Make extensive use of lists to stay focused and organized, including yearly, monthly, and daily to-do lists.  

3) Start and end each day with tasks you can make meaningful progress on to build momentum.  

4) Carefully consider what you choose to work on, as productivity is wasted if directed at the wrong goals.  

5) Develop strong beliefs and convictions, and have the confidence to stick with them rather than just agreeing with others.  

6)  Take time for thinking deeply by reading, engaging with interesting people, and spending time in nature.  

7) Delegate tasks to others based on their interests and strengths, as everyone is most productive doing what they enjoy.  

8) Be willing to make major job changes if you find yourself consistently disliking your work over an extended period.  

9) Optimize for allocating your year effectively rather than obsessing over minute productivity hacks.  

10) Embrace the power of compounding by making small, consistent productivity gains over time.
